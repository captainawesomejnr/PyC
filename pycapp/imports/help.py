  print("""Using the REPL
REPL stands for read-evaluate-print-loop. It refers to the way it works, by reading the command, doing the action, printing an output and doing that for every command. The REPL is a terminal where you can type in commands and they execute instantly.
To use a command, type it in the format of module.command(configuration). For example, to print 'Hello, World!' onto the screen, type pyc.writeline("Hello, World!")
