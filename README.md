# PyC: the way to code in Python, but simple.
Coding is hard in general. Python tries to aid in helping users with that learning curve, but it's not always easy, even with the help of a relatively easy language. That's where PyC comes in: it's a new language built off the foundations of Python for an easier experince. And it's backwards compatible with Python, so you can also use what Big Tech uses daily to run the services you rely on daily.
